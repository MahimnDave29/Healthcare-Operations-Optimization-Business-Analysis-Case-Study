## Case Study Overview
This case study focused on reducing patient wait times, improving scheduling accuracy, enhancing system integration, and mitigating operational risks through data-driven insights and process redesign.

## Challenges 
Manual appointment scheduling and double bookings.
Long patient wait times (30–45 minutes during peak hours).
Fragmented systems and limited real-time coordination.
Resource allocation imbalance.
Data security and compliance risks.

## Business Objectives
Reduce patient wait times by 20%.
Decrease scheduling conflicts by 30%.
Optimize resource utilization (doctors, nurses, rooms, equipment).
Improve patient satisfaction and communication.
Ensure regulatory compliance and system scalability.

## Insights
Based on the analysis of appointment, resource and feedback data, following insights were found:

Peak-hour congestion drives extended wait times.
Resource imbalance affects operational efficiency.
Technical risks (data security, system downtime) pose highest impact.
High patient satisfaction indicates strong service foundation but operational improvement potential.

## Recommendations
Implement automated scheduling with real-time conflict detection.
Deploy integrated Hospital Information System (HIS).
Introduce real-time resource dashboards.
Strengthen change management and staff training.

## Risk Areas
Data breaches and compliance risks.
System downtime during peak hours.
Staff resistance to new workflows.

## Deliverables
Business Requirement Documentation (BRD).
Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM).
Stakeholder Analysis.
Scope Management Plan.
Process Maps (BPMN & Swimlane).
Data Analysis Reports.
Risk Register & Mitigation Plan.
